# Data Quality Enhancement Steps

### Based on our analysis, we have identified two key steps to enhance data quality:

1. __Data Type Conversion:__ We will convert the data types of relevant columns to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. __Duplicate Detection and Removal:__ We will check for duplicate records and remove any redundant data to prevent bias and ensure the reliability of our analysis.

By taking these steps, we can ensure that our data is accurate, consistent, and reliable, laying the foundation for meaningful insights and informed decision-making.
